## [BETA] Biome Randomizer

Adds a new Chaos Trial which let's you traverse the biomes in a random order. Each biome is selected based on the number of bosses defeated so the biomes appear in their respective order.

Also supports Hades 1 biomes from [Zagreus Journey](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/). It is recommended to finish the H1 story in that mod before trying out the randomizer.

Note: To avoid breaking any saves this will only show up if you have already gotten the True Ending(credits) in Hades 2.

## Installation

Use r2modman by ebkr from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest).

While the mod has been tested decently well, there can still be some untested combination which breaks the game. It is recommended to backup your save from `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Hades II\Profile*.sav` in case there are issues.
